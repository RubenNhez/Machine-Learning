# Machine-Learning
Welcome to Machine Learning course which provides a broad introduction to machine learning and pattern recognition. The very general topics include supervised learning and learning theory (bias/variance tradeoff). The course also discusses recent applications of machine learning in various arias, including practical and research applications.
# Learning outcomes
- Describe and explain fundamental machine learning concepts
- Describe and explain representative machine learning algorithms for regression and classification, and be able to choose the appropriate methods to apply in various types of analyses
- Explain the methods of performance evaluation for machine learning models
- Apply and evaluate machine learning methods, and the results they produce on various datasets from different fields by developing suitable effective methodologies, using specialised software
